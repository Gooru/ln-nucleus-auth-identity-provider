##How to setup Shibboleth IdP

   - Generate the metadata using ```/api/nucleus-auth-idp/v1/shibboleth/generateMetadata``` from the environment 
     where this service is running e.g.```http://www.gooru.org/api/nucleus-auth-idp/v1/shibboleth/generateMetadata```
   - Share the metadata with partners to upload on Shibboleth IdP
   - There is no need to creating a new route for a new partner. Partners are required to pass the shibboleth IdP 
     entryPoint in the request and that will redirect user to their IdP for authentication
     e.g. ```http://www.gooru.org/api/nucleus-auth-idp/v1/shibboleth?entryPoint=https://idp.testshib.org/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO```
